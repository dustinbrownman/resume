## Summary
I am an aspiring full-stack web developer studying object-oriented design and test-driven development using mostly Ruby and JavaScript. I'm excited to join and contribute to the growing Portland tech community.

I've spent most of my career working with non-profits, leading volunteers, developing programs, planning events, and managing budgets. Over the last two years I've pursued a growing interest in programming. In July 2013 was accepted into Epicodus, an intensive 4 month, forty hours per week web development class in Portland, OR. What I am learning during this time is preparing me to enter the exciting world of tech as a junior-level developer.
